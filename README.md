This repo forms part of a project where I built the same app using Svelte, Nuxt, Next, Solid and Angular — all but one of which I'd never use before — in an effort to show that picking-up frameworks isn't quite the huge deal hiring managers seem to think it is...

The app itself is nothing overly fancy — just a basic film discovery site covering all the essentials one would expect such as search (actor/director/title), categories, filmographies, cast & crew. I took a classic ‘less is more’ approach with regards to the UI. It’s certainly not the most impressive thing you’ll ever see — but it is a perfectly functional single-page app fetching data from a live API, which is very much the bread and butter of modern front-end development.

All five repos can be found here on GitHub:

[github.com/nuxt-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nuxt-movies)

[github.com/solid-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/solid-movies)  
[github.com/angular-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/angular-movies)  

### Project Summary

Next is the only framework I was already familiar with. It took roughly 5 days to get a reasonable app up and running, which includes API integration and overall app design — all of which I’ll be using on subsequent projects, ultimately saving time, making it purely about each framework going forward. Overall, I found working with Next a breeze — no complaints there.
